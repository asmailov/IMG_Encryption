IMG_Encryption
==============
Program which alows user to encrypt and decrypt image using transformations, the symmetry group of a square - dihedral group of order 8.
Encrypted/decrypted image can be saved.
User can also view the animation of the whole process.

Once encrypted, image can be distributed freely and work as a public key. Only people with the private key are able to decrypt and view original image.

PUBLIC KEY - encrypted image.

PRIVATE KEY - sequence of transformations (example: [1, 2, 7, 3]), number of iterations, original picture's width and height.
